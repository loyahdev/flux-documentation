# What devices are supported with Flux?

**iPhones running iOS 16.0 or later**

* Fully supported with these devices in mind.

(Note that currently, Some themes only work on 16.2+)

**iPhones running iOS 15.0-15.7.2**

* Not officially supported as the Flux app is built for iOS 16 and up and the app will not install to your device.

There is most likely a somewhat easy way to bypass this with slight code modifications.

**iPhones running iOS 14.8.1 and earlier**

* Not supported, and never will be.

**iPads**

* Same rules apply as iPhones, however some tweaks might not work due to compatibility issues.
