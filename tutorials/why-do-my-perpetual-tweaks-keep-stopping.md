# Why Do My Perpetual Tweaks Keep Stopping?

Firstly, Legacy versions of ‘Windows 11 LS’ have some issues which prohibit it from running for a long time.

If you aren’t using that tweak, make sure you aren’t accidentally stopping your shortcut.

HTML themes usually run longer than non-HTML themes. You can check this by going into the tweak and looking for HTML.

**Experimental Solutions:**

1. Running the tweak from a widget will **apparently** make it last much longer.
2. Make an Automation in the Shortcuts app that runs the Flux Helper shortcut whenever any app is opened. This will ensure it re-runs in the background, which resets the metaphorical timer.
